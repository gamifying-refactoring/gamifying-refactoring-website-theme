      <description>Refactoring is an important concept which is really fun to learn and practice and I wanted to gamify it because it is such an important concept.
 Foundation of the idea The idea is to IDENTIFY code smells and understand or justify WHY is something really a smell. Don&amp;rsquo;t justify a smell on the grounds of understandability, readability or flexibility. Go beyond ilities and ities !! Don&amp;rsquo;t state &amp;ldquo;Long method is a smell because it is not readable&amp;rdquo;, rather consider this as an opportunity to go beyond reasoning which is not measurable.</description>

      <description>Structure of the game This game is played between 5 teams, each team consists of 2 players. The game is organized into 4 rounds - Round1, Round2, Round3 and Round4.
Round1 and round2 have 2 passes - each pass consists of 5 questions, one for each team.
Round2, Round3 and Round4 have a single pass each.
At the end of each round, a team with the lowest score gets eliminated.</description>

      <description>Rules of the game The rules are simple -
 Every question is designed with N smells The team answering a question needs to identify N smells and justify each of them, in a total of 2 minutes The team gets one point for each right smell and one point for each valid justification  No ilities, no ities while justifying a smell    Every game needs to have a &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; element in it.</description>

      <description>Writing code that has smells  Creating code with smells and that too intentionally was probably the most difficult part of the preparation.
 This is because of a few reasons -
 You don&amp;rsquo;t write code with smells in real life, at least not intentionally. Typically I would think about refactoring code but this time I had to tell my brain to think about writing code with smells. Felt like a lot of cognitive load in itself Writing code that reflects our not-so-obvious mistakes in daily life was another challenge Writing code with increasing level of complexity was a little tough for me I wanted to create questions where each question has N smells, (N &amp;gt;= 1).</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s do a virtual run Me&amp;gt; Team1 let me know once you are ready. I will share my screen and you get 2 minutes to identify and justify smells
Team1&amp;gt; We are ready
Me&amp;gt; Sharing my screen on Zoom and starting the timer. Your time starts now.
Expected smells = 3 Points for each smell = 1 Points for each justification = 1 Time available = 2 minutes No points for mentioning - 1.</description>

      <description>At the end of each round, a team with the lowest score gets eliminated. In order to eliminate ties, a set of questions have been prepared and each question has 2 ideas. A question will be floated around and one of the teams defends one idea while the other team stands against that idea. A debate kicks in and the winner gets safe.

      <description>It was learning combined with fun for me. Thinking about writing code with smells, thinking about the mistakes that I might make everyday while coding and thinking about the things that I might tend to ignore during development was the real fun.
 We all had good time going back to the roots and questioning things like &amp;ldquo;Why is long method really a smell&amp;rdquo;.
This was one of those times where we tried to move beyond &amp;ldquo;gut&amp;rdquo;, instead of saying &amp;ldquo;I think I can create an inheritance hierarchy here&amp;rdquo;, we focussed on &amp;ldquo;what is wrong with the current code&amp;rdquo;.</description>
