### What is refactoring?

{{% notice note %}}
Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a sequence of these transformations can produce a significant restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring.

### Why gamify such an important concept?

> Gamify it because it is such an important concept.

Have fun while learning and practising refactoring. Look at a code which has smells, **identify smells**, **justify each smell** and **get points** for each identification and justification :) 

The focus is to **IDENTIFY** code smells and understand **WHY** is something really a smell. 

**Don't** justify smell on the grounds of understandab**ility**, readab**ility** or flex**ibility**. Go beyond **ilities** and **ities** !! 

**Don't** focus on "I **feel** this method does not belong here", rather focus on "The current approach is **feature envy**".
