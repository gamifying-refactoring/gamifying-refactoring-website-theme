> Refactoring is an important concept which is really fun to learn and practice and I wanted to gamify it because it is such an important concept.


### Foundation of the idea 

{{% notice note %}} 
The idea is to **IDENTIFY** code smells and understand or justify **WHY** is something really a smell. 
**Don't** justify a smell on the grounds of understandab**ility**, readab**ility** or flexib**ility**. Go beyond **ilities** and **ities** !! 
**Don't** state "Long method is a smell because it is not readable", rather consider this as an opportunity to go beyond reasoning which is not measurable.

#### Go beyond ilities and your gut to figure out why is something really a smell.

Before moving on, I will quickly mention the definition of refactoring which is shamefully copied from [refactoring.com](https://refactoring.com) - 

{{% notice note %}} 
Refactoring is a **disciplined technique** for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior. Its heart is a series of **small behavior preserving transformations**. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a **sequence of these transformations** can produce a **significant restructuring**. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring.
