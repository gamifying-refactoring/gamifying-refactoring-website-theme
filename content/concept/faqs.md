| Question | Answer |
| ------ | ----------- |
| What happens to a question for which a team **can not identify all the smells**? | That question becomes **OPEN** for any other team to pick |
| What happens to a question for which a team can identify the smells **but not justify**? | That question becomes **OPEN** for any other team to justify |
| How does a team **pick an OPEN** question? | A team or any of its members needs to ping **Picked** on Zoom chat after I confirm a question as OPEN |
| What if **more than one team pings Picked** on Zoom? | The **first 2 teams** to ping “Picked” get the OPEN question |
| What are the **rules for OPEN question**? | You get **1 minute to identify and justify remaining smells**, and you get **double of all the points**: 2 points for each smell, 2 for each valid justification |
| What if **no team signs up for an OPEN question**? | Question gets discussed within the group and we move on to the next team with next question |
| What happens if more than one team get the lowest score after a round ends? | **Tie-breaker** kicks in |
| How does a tie-breaker work? | A set of questions have been prepared and each question has 2 ideas. A question will be floated around and one of the teams defends one idea while the other team stands against that idea. A debate kicks in and the winner gets safe. |
| What is special about Round 4, the last round? | It is the **MEGA** round. There is ONLY one question. Teams get **one point for each identified smell** and **two points for each valid justification** |
