### What are the rules of the game?

The rules are simple -
 
+ Every question is designed with N smells
+ The team answering a question needs to identify N smells and justify each of them, in a total of 2 minutes
+ The team gets one point for each right smell and one point for each valid justification
    + **No ilities, no ities** while justifying a smell

Every game needs to have a "fun" element in it. Keeping this in mind, a concept of OPEN question was brought in.

### OPEN question

+ If a team can not identify or justify all the smells, the question becomes OPEN for any other team to pick.
+ In order to pick an OPEN question, a team or any of its members needs to ping “Picked” on Zoom chat after the question has been confirmed OPEN
+ The first 2 teams to ping “Picked” get the OPEN question

OPEN questions also push other teams have to be attentive because this is an opportunity for them to score.

+ The team gets double of all the points: 2 points for each smell and 2 for each valid justification
