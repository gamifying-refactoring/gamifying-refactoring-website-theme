### What is refactoring?

> Refactoring is a **disciplined technique** for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior. Its heart is a series of **small behavior preserving transformations**. Each transformation (called a "refactoring") does little, but a **sequence of these transformations** can produce a **significant restructuring**. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is kept fully working after each refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring.

### Why gamify such an important concept?

{{% notice note %}} 
Gamify it because it is such an important concept.
{{% /notice %}} 

Look at a code which has smells, **identify smells**, **justify each smell** and **get points** for each identification and justification :) 

The focus is to **IDENTIFY** code smells and understand **WHY** is something really a smell. 

**Don't** justify a smell on the grounds of understandab**ility**, readab**ility** or flex**ibility**. Go beyond **ilities** and **ities** !! 

**Don't** state "I **feel** this method does not belong here", rather state "This method is **feature envy**". 
 
#### Go beyond ilities and your gut to figure out why is something really a smell.
