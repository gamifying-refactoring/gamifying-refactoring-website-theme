# Let's gamify refactoring

It was the last day of our project and I wanted to connect with my team for the last time (at least in the project), not to say goodbye but to have some fun. I couldn't think of any idea better than "Gamifying Refactoring" and that is how the idea came to life.

> Refactoring is **fun to learn and practice**. It is even more fun if you get to learn it together by playing a game. All you got to do is - identify code smells, justify each of them by **going beyond ilities**, finish all of this in a fixed time and get points for your team. Learn and have fun. This is the idea behind "Gamifying Refactoring".


#### Let's understand the game, its structure, its rules and have some fun.
