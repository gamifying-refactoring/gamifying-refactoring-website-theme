I am sure you did not expect this page but this is the reality ![Smiley](/images/smiley.png?width=20px&classes=smiley).

Trust me, code for this game exists in reality. It is available in **Python** and **Java** at this moment. Code is also planned in other programming languages and should be available soon. 

This is how the overall plan looks at the moment -

Code for this game is placed in a private git repository within an organization [here](https://github.com/gamifying-refactoring). Getting access to the code involves the following steps -

1. Write to me
2. Share you github id or your github team

I will then provide you the access to all code repositories for the game ![Smiley](/images/smiley.png?width=20px&classes=smiley).
